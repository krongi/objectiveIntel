I love driving my friend's nuts in any way I can. Why not send them a bunch of text messages while they're at work? Well unless you do it manually there was not app to do this. I used tasker on android to create an app the select a phone number and create a text that could be sent as many times as you wanted using any interval in seconds that you deemed necessary. Want to send a message every 1 minute? Great! Every 30 seconds? Sure. Every 5 seconds? Be careful. Needless to say, use this responsibly and sparingly
