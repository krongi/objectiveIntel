This system was designed when I began to run low on visco fuse to use with my rockets and other pyrotechnics. Visco is about $15 for 25 feet but nichrome wire is only $8 to get 300 feet. This system uses ESP32 LoRa modules to send and receive the signal to launch. This allows a great distance between you and the device you're igniting
